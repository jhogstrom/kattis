# KATTIS

I was reading [a book on competitive programming](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Programming-3rd-Steven-Halim/dp/B00FG8MNN8) and was checking out some references.

Eventually I landed on https://open.kattis.com/ and as my life felt somewhat empty after (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/] had just finished, I decided to play around with some of the challenges.

This repo contains my submissions.

It is probably better to just go back to reading the book :)
