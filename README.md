# KATTIS

I was reading [a book on competitive programming](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Programming-3rd-Steven-Halim/dp/B00FG8MNN8) and was checking out some references.

Eventually I landed on https://open.kattis.com/ and as my life felt somewhat empty after (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/] had just finished, I decided to play around with some of the challenges.

This repo contains my submissions.

It'd' probably better to just go back to reading the book, but it is fun writing code :)

the batch file `e.bat` takes one argument. It will pipe the `<argument>.txt` through `<argument>.py`.
This helps mimick the ways tests are run on open.kattis.com.

In some cases there is no `*.txt`-file. Typically that's because the input is a single line, and I just typed/pasted that in when running.

Note that I've been somewhat lazy and cherry picked the easy problems...
